May 2020 - time flies :)





Today I was researching companies that are helping Ukraine and got a link to your website. 

I was sleepy and started reading it. 

And then I was like: "hold on, it's very familiar. let's open the About Us page" 

I didn't recognize your profile picture, but I know your name. I go to my inbox and find your recent email :)



I think it was a sign that I need to message you. Below is a long read, so I’m not expecting a quick reply. Take as much time as you need.



There are a few reasons why I'm writing this letter to you. 

We have a war in Ukraine. My granny doesn't want to evacuate, so I am stuck in Kharkiv(too close to russia that I want to be). my teammates offered me to join them and start to build a business community that will learn how to operate during the war. This is why we started to build a database of companies that are trying their best to help Ukrainians.



I don't want to play the pity card. We are a very brave nation and prove it each day.

As I can't shoot, I want to try to help my people by creating jobs and getting money from outside of Ukraine. 

I have experience and I think I don't have another choice. 



I have a few projects that I'm trying to build - maybe it will be interesting to you or your community of founders.



food tech

I'm trying to build a "Food Tech Alliance". I have knowledge of how to build food tech projects. A lot of them have similar working gears. But usually, foodies aren't tech-savvy, so they build things from scratch. They make mistakes and burn money. 



I'm building small and isolated code modules that can be used many times. 

- Like recipes apps still need a database of ingredients. 

- A meal planner for people with diabetes should have it too. 

- People with allergies should also know what ingredients their meal has. 

and I'm not talking about databases, backups, and DevOps stuff :)

tools for newsletters

I was working as an editor in Hackernoon magazine. And I was involved in the production of thematic newsletters.

I learned a lot and as a developer in my soul, I tried to optimize it. I and my team of students started to build a tool that will convert content from Markdown into working email-friendly HTML that is ready to be sent. 



In step 1 - we want to provide help to companies that use newsletters as part of their work and help them to grow and optimize things. Building newsletters and sending ongoing campaigns is a huge challenge. I know it because we delivered about 4 million emails during my work there. And I'm sure many more since I left. This step is necessary for optimizing our tools and building a coding team that can move us forward.



`i noticed that we might help you with your newsletter production too :)`



`btw, i noticed that 2 campaigns are sitting in my spam folder, maybe you need to clean up your list or some links was sitting in spam libraries`



For step 2 we need to finish the cool open-source backend server that was abandoned by the FreeCodeCamp team and optimize it for our needs. Probably we'll create 2 different projects around it. I want to help small companies with subscribers number less than 20.000 and companies with lists of more than 150.000 subs. Both types need to send emails, but they have different goals, different pain points, etc. it will help us to get a stable revenue source and be able to expand.



For step 3 I have my partner. While I was investing in small tools and trying to build startups - he was expanding his knowledge as a software architect. He was working on a secret Lenova project and helped them to create huge and expandable configurations. While most of the tools are open-sourced, it was a great challenge to make everything work well.

We wouldn't steal anything, also tools evolving pretty fast, and guys like Amazon AWS working as beasts.



So when we'll have resources, he will stop sleeping and in 4-8 months, hopefully, will create a masterpiece. His email cluster will be an out-of-the-box solution. And if someone decides to form a team and recreate it from scratch, it will cost ~$200.000 in salaries or more.

a business community for UA businesses

This project came from a need to restart the economy of Ukraine. War isn't over and we have already suffered huge losses in different terms. I know that I can't fix it myself. But we need to start by taking small steps. And a lot of people around me are "damaged". You cant think about the future, while bombs are flying. But we need to learn how to do it.



So when my teammates offered me to join and try to do what we can - I quickly said yes - even realizing that I can't work on anything full-time. My mind isn't ready yet, but we are trying our best. Businesses in destroyed cities are moving into Craiglist times, so everything must be reimagined from scratch. Plus, people with big money evacuated during the first days of the war, and entrepreneurial skills are in demand right now. New employees, relocation of businesses of different sizes, logistics, and delivery of goods are our new problems that we need to solve as a nation.



It’s also a great time to integrate cryptocurrency into our economy even more - because there are like 5% of working ATMs in Kharkiv right now. So it’s the best time to kill paper money :) 



As our first step - we’ll release a simple website based on Notion with information for business owners about how to work during the war. Then we’ll try to connect businesses that are trying to do something right now. 



From girls that offer nail service(they were the first), cakes for celebrating birthdays to coffee shops that are really important to our soldiers. During the first few weeks, when things were hard, me and my mom cooked coffee as a factory for our defenders :)  



Hope you enjoyed reading this letter and sorry for my English. 

Be safe and #StayWithUkraine
