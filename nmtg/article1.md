Im interested to present you an exciting probem that we are trying o solve.
It's exciting because I like to dig into issue, similar to this one, related to coding somethings, when you are working as developer you cant spend enought time on thinking about stuff like this one.

Because you need to make things work quickly and sometimes, it's looks better in your head to just patch things up and introduce more code debt, onsdead of separating a problem from a scope and attacking it.

So, even our 2 year old project is getting hard to manage from different standpoints.
In my opinion we are moving too slow, also keeping with us old burden that starting to eat our brains out.

let's face it - eeven with small project that we have - we can stuck and even so small project can have a lot of tech debt that i dont like.
We cant expand quickly - and we need help!

Less dramaticallyy, Im saying that we need to have a better coverage for our needs, i.e something similar to infrastructure.


So error handling: we have it, but it can be better. One of our measurement points - we still have issues we update stuff and generator gets broken.



And modular approach is not effective as it sound in my head(i'm still looking for ways to make it work) in terms of debugging it's not helpful, when you need to quickly jump between files and debug an attribute inside of one function.
while it's not our fault - there still a lot of functions that we updating constantly.
But I hope soon some of them become concrete solid and will be ready to move out from our main codebase.
