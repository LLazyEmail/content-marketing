### Measurements

Today I want to show you another module that I grab. While data aren't full and I dont remeber where I get it.

But I think it's cool to release it as simple module that possible to use. I used the same approach --> RollupJS + Babel

Later probably I want to convert it into Typescript and Types. And Babel must do magic that can make it work with ES5, ES6


Also, Im curious to mix it with mathematical modules, like "fractions", because I remember some examples, where ....


There also additional cases, that might be also covered and your developers probably not aware about cases.


Like if I have a recipe that was calculated as meal prep for 4 people.

But if I have 5 people today? And now I have, problems with measurements in spoons, cups, problems with measurements 

and now it should show 1.25 spoons
