During April I realized that it is not easy for me to focus on small modules only.
My ego needs a bigger thing that I want to bite. Otherwise im getting bored, Lazy and have 

a low level of energy inside.


So i decided to dream bigger(again). Doing modules is simple, I just need to figure out a 

money problem and hire someone for a small tasks completion.

[expand it]

The next step(when 5-8 modules will work as I wish in my head) - I wanna pack them as 

microservices, then to build an API or setup another way for communication layer between 

those modules.

My goal is to evolve this project from having code that was written in JS into a set of 

really working tools, that can be used by others. I also want to make it cross-platform and 

stack-agnostic, so it can be used by different package managers, other coding languages. 

Plus, it must be scallable some-sort, very easy to deploy and code. And here is a place 

where my frined, with DevOps skills will be very useful.
